Welcome to Introduction to Bioimage Analysis using QuPath!
==============================================================

This deck of slides introduces participants to the key concepts of bioimage analysis using the open-source software **QuPath**. It is designed as a primer for biologists who need to analyze images as part of their research but are new to image analysis.

The following materials were developed for a workshop taught in-person at **Harvard Medical School**, organized by the `Image Analysis Collaboratory <https://iac.hms.harvard.edu/>`__.
