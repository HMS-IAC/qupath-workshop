Welcome to Introduction to Bioimage Analysis using QuPath!
===========================================================

This deck of slides introduces participants to the main ideas of bioimage analysis using the open-source software QuPath. 
It is designed as a primer on QuPath for busy biologists who need to analyze images part of their research.

The following materials were designed for a workshop taught in-person at Harvard Medical School organized by the `Image Analysis Collaboratory <https://iac.hms.harvard.edu/>`__.
