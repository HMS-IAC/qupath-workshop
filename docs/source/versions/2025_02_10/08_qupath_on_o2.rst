QuPath on O2
===============

We have developed a tool that facilitates the use of the bioimage analysis software, including QuPath, on the O2 cluster. 
It allows you to use QuPath through its GUI, and also to run it from the command line for batch processing.

More information specific to the QuPath installer on O2 can be found `here <https://hms-iac.github.io/Bioimage-Analysis-on-O2/GUI/index.html>`__.
